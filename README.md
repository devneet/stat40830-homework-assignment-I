# Data Analysis: Effects of Vitamin C on Tooth Growth in Guinea Pigs

This project explores the `ToothGrowth` dataset, which originates from a classic biological experiment measuring the effects of **vitamin C dosage** and **delivery method** (orange juice vs. vitamin C) on tooth development in guinea pigs.

The goal of this project is to:

-   Summarize tooth length statistics (mean, standard deviation) grouped by supplement type and dose\
-   Visualize how dosage and delivery method influence tooth growth using an interactive boxplot\
-   Interpret whether the combination of **dose** and **supplement type** significantly affects dental development

The analysis has been implemented using **R** and **Quarto**.
