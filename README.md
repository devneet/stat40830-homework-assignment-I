# Data Analysis: Motor Trend Car Road Tests

This data analysis project is based on the classic `mtcars` dataset, which originates from the 1974 issue of *Motor Trend* magazine. This repository contains an exploratory data analysis report that investigates the relationship between **engine horsepower** and **fuel efficiency** (miles per gallon) for a variety of car models.

The goal of this project is to:

- Summarize key statistics (mean, standard deviation) of vehicle performance metrics  
- Visualize the trade-off between horsepower and fuel economy using an interactive scatterplot  
- Interpret and communicate insights in a reproducible and visually appealing format

The analysis has been implemented using **R** and **Quarto**.
